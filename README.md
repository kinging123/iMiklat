An app to find the nearest bomb shelters in Israel


In July 2014, Protective Edge Operation has began in Israel. Since then, over 4,000 missiles were fired to Israel. 

Every day, thousands of people have less than 90 seconds to run torwards a shelter, because if they won't - they might die.

Finding a near shelter within 10 to 90 seconds is not easy at all. At TLW HackerCamp 2014 we tried to find a solution to that problem.

When you open the app's current Alpha on your phone or directly from the [web](http://projects.karasik.org/imiklat), you can select a city and a neighborhood in a city and see, as pins on the Google Map, all the public shelters that we have in out database, which is imported from the municipalities' documents.

If every Israeli would know how to get to a near bomb shelter every time there's a CODE RED ALARM, lifes could be saved.

Please spread the work and share this app on Social Networks.
